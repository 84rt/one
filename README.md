The One App is the only app that you really need on your phone, or at least the only app that you want.


The main idea is to make an app that does the following:

- Keep track of habits
- Keeps track of achievemetns and life progress
- Keeps track of absitance from negative things (and substances)
- Has a sprint pomodoro built into it so that you can do minimal todo list managmenet with it
